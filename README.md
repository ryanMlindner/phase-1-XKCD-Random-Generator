# phase-1-XKCD-Random-Generator

# Runtime instructions:
 - install json-server
 - $ json-server --watch db.json

# Project Pitch:
A bare bones API to fetch an xkcd comic of the users choice, or a random one. The website shows
the comic, details about the comic, and provides a form to submit comments or like the comic, and displays
information about the users interaction with the site.

# User Stories: 
 - As a user, I want to be able to look at an xkcd comic of my choice, or a random one, so there
should be a display of the comic and data about it.
 - As a user, I want to be able to see all of the comics available to display, so there should be
a collection of comics that I can click to view them.
 - As a user, I want to be able to interact with the comics, so there should be a like button that persists a number of likes across sessions.
 - As a user, I want to be able to have a profile picture and username to display on the screen, so
there should be a form to input those fields and display them.
 - As a user, I want to be able to change the style on the page, so there should be css classes for light
and dark mode, and a toggle button to swap between them.
